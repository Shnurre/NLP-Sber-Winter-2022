We 're about to see if advertising works .
Hard on the heels of Friday 's 190 - point stock - market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : Keep on investing , the market 's just fine .
Their mission is to keep clients from fleeing the market , as individual investors did in droves after the crash in October
Just days after the 1987 crash , major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors .
This time around , they 're moving even faster .
PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night .
Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today .
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads .
It considered running them during tomorrow night 's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday .
Other brokerage firms , including Merrill Lynch & Co. , were plotting out potential new ad strategies .
The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around , when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic .
This time , the firms were ready .
Fidelity , for example , prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge .
When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon , the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers .
The ads touted Fidelity 's automated 800 - number beneath the huge headline , `` Fidelity Is Ready For Your Call '' .
A Fidelity spokesman says the 800 - line , which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about , received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend .
`` A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , '' he says .
`` To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial .
It would have been too late to think about on Friday .
We had to think about it ahead of time '' .
Today 's Fidelity ad goes a step further , encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity .
Underneath the headline `` Diversification , '' it counsels , `` Based on the events of the past week , all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility '' .
It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name .
PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash .
In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage firm began taping commercials in - house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night .
It also negotiated an arrangement with Cable News Network under which CNN would agree to air its last - minute creations .
The new PaineWebber commercial , created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , features Mary Farrell , one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists , sounding particularly bullish .
Taped just as the market closed yesterday , it offers Ms. Farrell advising , `` We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle ... .
We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long - term appreciation '' .
The spot was scheduled to appear three times on CNN last night .
PaineWebber considered an even harder sell , recommending specific stocks .
Instead , it settled on just urging the clients who are its lifeline to keep that money in the market .
`` We 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives the prices down further , '' says John Lampe , PaineWebber 's director of advertising .
`` If you owned it and liked it Friday , the true value has n't changed '' .
He adds , `` This is n't 1987 revisited '' .
With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly revise their approach .
At Shearson Lehman , executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend , then had to regroup yesterday afternoon .
The plan had been to make one of Shearson 's easy - to - film , black - and - white `` Where We Stand '' commercials , which have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985 .
The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow , replacing the debut commercial of Shearson 's new ad campaign , `` Leadership by Example '' .
But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday , Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock - market ad .
`` We do n't think at this point anything needs to be said .
The market seems to be straightening out ; we 're taking a wait - and - see attitude , '' says Cathleen B. Stewart , executive vice president of marketing .
In any case , the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987 .
But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective .
In 1987 , despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms , individuals ran from the market en masse .
Now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around .

You know what the law of averages is , do n't you ?
Baseball , that game of the long haul , is the quintessential sport of the mean , and the mean ol ' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend .
The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home - team Oakland A 's , the gang that had been done unto similarly by the Los Angeles Dodgers and Orel Hershiser in last year 's tournament .
Morever , much of the damage was accomplished by A 's who had some catching up to do .
In game two , on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn , a lot of the catching up was done by the A 's catcher , Terry Steinbach .
He hit a 2 - 0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left - field stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from 2 - 1 to a decisive 5 - 1 , where it stayed .
So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular - season games , and batted in the seventh position of the A 's lineup .
`` If you get your pitch , and take a good swing , anything can happen , '' he later remarked .
On Saturday night , quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and , no doubt , future droughts .
Mark McGwire , the big , red - haired Oakland first baseman , had three hits in four at bats , two more than he 'd had in the five - game Dodger series in which he 'd gone 1 - for - 17 .
The A-men batting Nos. 6 through 9 , a.k.a. the `` bottom of the order , '' got seven of their team 's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5 - 0 decision .
Right - hander Dave Stewart held the Giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday ledger .
That he was the A 's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21 - 9 mark , plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs , indicates he may have some evening up coming , but with the way his split - fingered fastball is behaving , that might not be this week .
The same goes for Mike Moore , another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in Sunday 's contest .
`` Every guy they put out there had a better split - finger than the guy before , '' marveled Giant manager Roger Craig .
He 's an ex-hurler who 's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery , which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat .
The upshot of the downshoot is that the A 's go into San Francisco 's Candlestick Park tonight up two games to none in the best - of - seven fest .
The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs - LRB - 29 of 39 - RRB - that took 2 - 0 Series leads went on to win it all .
That 's not an average to soothe Giant rooters .
One might think that the home fans in this Series of the Subway Called BART - LRB - that 's a better name for a public conveyance than `` Desire , '' do n't you think ? - RRB - would have been ecstatic over the proceedings , but they observe them in relative calm .
Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000 - plus seats of Oakland Coliseum , and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition , hostilities advanced no further , at least as far as I could see .
A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams .
`` I 'm for the Giants today , but only because they lost yesterday .
I love ' em both .
The only thing I 'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games , '' said David Williams , a Sacramento septuagenarian , at the Coliseum before Sunday 's go .
The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility .
I choose to believe it 's the latter , although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the A 's and Giants , is originally from somewhere else .
Suffice it to say that if this were a New York Yankees - Mets series , or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox - LRB - hey , it 's possible - RRB - , you 'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans , and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets .
Anyway , the A 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for .
In the opening game , besides Steinbach and Stewart , there was Walt Weiss , a twiggy - looking , second - year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery .
He was flawless afield - LRB - ditto in game two - RRB - , moved a runner along in the A 's three - run second inning , and homered for his team 's final tally .
Such is his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season , the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph .
Not his autograph ; power - hitter McGwire 's .
An A 's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson , who exemplifies the hot side of the hot - cold equation .
He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats , and continued that by going 3 - for - 3 at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run .
`` When you 're in the groove , you see every ball tremendously , '' he lectured .
The cold guys in the set were Will Clark , Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams , the Giants ' 3 - 4 - 5 hitters .
They combined for 25 hits , six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the Cubs .
They went a collective 5 - for - 24 here , with zero homers and ribbies .
It 's that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come .
`` I believe in the law of averages , '' declared San Francisco batting coach Dusty Baker after game two .
`` I 'd rather see a so - so hitter who 's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who 's cold '' .
But the old Dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side .
`` When it goes , you never know when you 'll get it back , '' he said .
`` That 's baseball .
NCR Corp. reported a 10 % drop in third - quarter net income , citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip .
Net income for the quarter fell to $ 93.1 million from $ 103.1 million , roughly what analysts had expected .
But per - share profit dropped only 2 % to $ 1.23 a share from $ 1.26 a share , as the company continued its stock buy - back plan .
Average shares outstanding dropped to 75.8 million from 82.1 million .
Revenue fell 1 % to $ 1.39 billion from $ 1.41 billion .
The computer maker , which sells more than half its goods outside the U.S. , also said the negative effect of a stronger U.S. dollar will `` adversely affect '' its fourth - quarter performance and `` make it difficult '' to better 1988 results .
NCR said revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas , reflecting a world - wide softening of the computer markets .
The company , however , said orders in the U.S. showed `` good gains '' during the latest quarter .
Analysts estimate those gains at 12 % to 13 % , a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of NCR 's major customers .
In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry , NCR , which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers , is also affected by the retail and financial sectors , `` areas of the economy that have generally not been robust , '' notes Sanjiv G. Hingorani , an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc .
These factors , combined with a strong dollar , should negatively affect the current quarter 's results , NCR said .
In the year - earlier fourth quarter , NCR had profit of $ 149.6 million , or $ 1.85 a share , on revenue of $ 1.8 billion .
Mr. Hingorani said he lowered his full - year estimates for 1989 to $ 5.35 a share from $ 5.50 a share .
Revenue projections were slashed to $ 6.03 billion from $ 6.20 billion .
Last year , NCR had net income of $ 439.3 million , or $ 5.33 a share , on $ 5.99 billion in revenue .
For the nine months , the company 's earnings fell 9 % to $ 264.6 million , or $ 3.40 a share , from $ 289.7 million , or $ 3.49 a share .
Revenues declined 1 % to $ 4.17 billion from $ 4.19 billion .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , NCR shares fell 75 cents to close at $ 57 .
J.P. Morgan & Co. swung to a loss in the third quarter , while NCNB Corp. reported net income more than doubled , and Security Pacific Corp. net rose 10 % .
J.P. Morgan & Co .
J.P. Morgan , as expected , posted a $ 1.82 billion net loss for the quarter , reflecting the New York bank 's decision last month to add $ 2 billion to reserves for losses on loans to less - developed countries .
The reserve addition placed the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. among a few major U.S. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long - term portfolios to less - developed countries with reserves .
The latest quarter 's loss equals $ 9.92 a share .
In the year - earlier quarter , Morgan earned $ 233.6 million , or $ 1.25 a share .
George M. Salem , analyst at Prudential - Bache Securities Inc. , called the results `` mildly disappointing '' .
Excluding the $ 2 billion provision and allowing for the taxes Morgan paid , earnings were about 65 cents a share , Mr. Salem said .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Morgan climbed $ 1.50 a share to $ 44.125 .
Net interest income sank 27 % in the quarter to $ 254 million from $ 347 million .
The interest rate on short - term funds , which banks borrow to finance longer - term loans to customers , was `` sharply higher , '' Morgan said .
Morgan received $ 2 million of interest payments on its medium and long - term Brazilian loans ; had they been accruing interest , net interest income would have been $ 35 million higher in the quarter , Morgan said .
Such loans to Argentina also remain classified as non-accruing , costing the bank $ 10 million of interest income in the third period .
Income from sources other than interest climbed 12 % to $ 414 million , reflecting higher corporate - finance and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities .
`` These increases were partly offset by lower trading - related '' income , the bank said .
Non-interest expenses grew 16 % to $ 496 million .
NCNB Corp .
NCNB Corp. 's net income more than doubled in the period , largely because of continued strong performance by the bank 's Texas operations .
The Charlotte , N.C. , company said earnings rose to $ 143.6 million , or $ 1.45 a share , from $ 58.9 million , or 69 cents a share , a year earlier .
The latest quarter included a gain of $ 56.1 million , or 59 cents a share , related to the purchase of the remaining 51 % of NCNB Texas National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
The strong performance , however , contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of NCNB 's problem loans , particularly in the Southeast .
In the third quarter , nonperforming assets jumped to $ 474.1 million , or 1.43 % of net loans and leases , from $ 232.8 million , or 1.13 % in the second quarter .
Nonperformers totaled $ 230.8 million , or 1.27 % in the year - ago third quarter .
Included in the increase in the most recent quarter is a $ 33 million loan , which NCNB said it `` expects to be fully repaid , with no loss , early in the fourth quarter '' .
The deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of 17 % in NCNB 's Southeast operations , as well as a 28 % growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign .
The higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze NCNB 's net interest margin in the Southeast to 3.38 % from 3.80 % a year earlier .
In Big Board composite trading yesterday , NCNB jumped $ 3.50 a share , to $ 51 .
Results were released after the market closed .
NCNB Texas National , formed from the remnants of of the failed First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas , contributed $ 76.9 million to NCNB 's bottom line in the third quarter .
NCNB said its third - quarter results reflect 100 % of earnings of the Texas operation since Aug. 1 .
NCNB raised some $ 1.9 billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the NCNB Texas purchase , and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise .
Last week , the banking company said it purchased both Freedom Savings & Loan Association , Tampa , Fla. , and University Federal Savings Association of San Antonio , Texas , for $ 169.4 million .
In the first nine months , NCNB 's net income climbed 65 % to $ 310.9 million , or $ 3.30 a share , from $ 188.2 million , or $ 2.22 a share , a year earlier .
Security Pacific Corp .
Security Pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter , but the Los Angeles bank holding company was still able to post a 10 % increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real - estate and consumer loans .
Net rose to $ 185.1 million , or $ 1.55 a share , from $ 167.9 million , or $ 1.47 a share , a year earlier .
The company said the gain resulted mainly from a $ 54 million increase in net interest income , reflecting a 33 % increase in real estate loans - LRB - mainly residential - RRB - , and a 19 % rise in consumer loans .
These high - yielding loans in effect replaced some low - yielding assets such as inter-bank loans , which were allowed to decrease .
As a result , Security Pacific 's net interest margin fell only 13 basis points , a more mild decrease than some major banks outside California , which have been reporting more sluggish earnings .
Security Pacific shares closed at $ 44.625 , down 37.5 cents , in Big Board composite trading .
The earnings represent a 0.89 % return on assets for Security Pacific , and an 18.9 % return on equity .
The loan growth offset continuing real - estate loan losses in the depressed Arizona market .
Security Pacific reported a 33 % increase in net credit losses for the quarter , to $ 109 million from $ 81.9 million in the year - ago period .
Nonperforming loans grew slightly to $ 1.75 billion at Sept. 30 , from $ 1.7 billion a year ago .
Security Pacific 's loan - loss provision was down 22 % , or $ 30.4 million , because it added to its foreign - debt reserve the year before .
Non-interest income fell 6 % in the quarter , mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of Hong Kong banking operations .
Non-interest expense grew only 4 % in the period .
For the nine months , net rose 17 % to $ 548.9 million , or $ 4.67 a share , from $ 469.4 million , or $ 4.13 a share , a year earlier .
LIN Broadcasting Corp. said it wo n't take a position on a revised tender offer by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. to buy LIN and has asked for clarification of the offer .
